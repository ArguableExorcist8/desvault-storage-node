## 1. Introduction

In today’s digital era, data is one of the most valuable assets—but its centralized storage exposes it to risks such as data breaches, unauthorized access, and single points of failure. DesVault introduces a decentralized approach to storage that not only enhances security and privacy but also improves reliability and scalability. By distributing data across a network of nodes and leveraging strong encryption protocols, DesVault aims to redefine secure storage and ensure that users maintain true ownership of their digital content.

## 2. Problem Statement

Centralized storage solutions have become ubiquitous; however, they pose several challenges:
- **Security Vulnerabilities:** Centralized systems are attractive targets for hackers, leading to data breaches.
- **Privacy Concerns:** User data can be accessed or surveilled by unauthorized parties.
- **Single Point of Failure:** Centralized architectures are prone to outages and service interruptions.
- **Limited Scalability:** As data grows exponentially, centralized infrastructures struggle to scale efficiently.

DesVault addresses these challenges by distributing storage across a decentralized network, ensuring that no single entity controls the data while maintaining high security standards.

---

## 3. Proposed Solution

DesVault offers a comprehensive decentralized storage solution that:
- **Distributes Data Across a Peer-to-Peer Network:** Files are broken into shards and stored across multiple nodes.
- **Utilizes Robust Encryption:** Strong cryptographic techniques protect data both in transit and at rest.
- **Integrates Hybrid Storage Options:** Supports local storage as well as seamless cloud integration.
- **Facilitates Secure and Efficient Data Retrieval:** Real-time peer discovery and API services enable efficient file access.
- **Plans for Future Blockchain Integration:** To further enhance trust, transparency, and decentralization in the storage network.

## 4. Technical Architecture

### 4.1 Node Architecture

DesVault’s network is composed of different types of nodes:
- **Storage Nodes:** Responsible for storing file shards and managing local file encryption/decryption.
- **Seed Nodes:** Act as bootstrap peers to aid in network discovery and ensure connectivity.
- **API and Management Nodes:** Provide a centralized interface for file upload/download operations and network monitoring (with plans for a hybrid API with failover).

Each node is designed to run a single role to maintain resource isolation and security. Nodes communicate over designated ports:
- **IPFS Daemon:** Runs on port 5001 for decentralized networking.
- **API Server:** Runs on port 8080 for handling file operations.
- **Secure QUIC Channel:** Runs on port 4242 for TLS-based communications.

### 4.2 API and Service Integration

The API server manages file uploads, downloads, and metadata storage. It also enforces rate limiting and secure headers, ensuring that only authenticated users can interact with the system. Additionally, local nodes connect to a central Master API for coordination, while multiple seed nodes support decentralized peer discovery.

### 4.3 Security, Rate Limiting, and Data Management

- **Encryption & Data Security:**  
  Files are encrypted using state-of-the-art techniques before being sharded and distributed. Data integrity is maintained throughout the network.

- **Rate Limiting:**  
  A token bucket algorithm limits API requests (e.g., 1 request per second with a burst capacity of 5) to protect against abuse.

- **File Specifications:**  
  - **Upload Speed (Moderate):** 5–10 Mbps  
  - **Download Speed (Moderate):** 10–25 Mbps  
  - **Maximum File Size:** 500 MB per file (larger files are rejected)

## 5. Current Features

- **Peer-to-Peer Encrypted Storage:** Secure, decentralized file storage with robust encryption to protect your data.
- **Hybrid Storage Options:** Supports both local storage and cloud integration.
- **Decentralized Node Networking:** Advanced peer discovery with multiple seed nodes ensures resilient connectivity.
- **Real-Time Analytics & Health Monitoring:** Live insights into node performance, network connectivity, and overall system health.
- **Comprehensive API & CLI Tools:** An intuitive command-line interface and secure API endpoints enable efficient management and monitoring.
- **Modular & Scalable Architecture:** Designed to easily integrate additional features and scale with increasing demand.

---

## 6. Future Enhancements

- **Blockchain Integration:**  
  Future support for blockchain technology to further decentralize the network and enhance trust and transparency.

- **Enhanced API Failover Mechanisms:**  
  Implementation of robust failover strategies to ensure uninterrupted service even if the primary API encounters issues.

- **Performance Optimizations:**  
  Continuous improvements aimed at reducing latency, increasing file processing speeds, and scaling the network efficiently.

- **Collaborative Chat:**  
  Advanced real-time chat functionality to foster communication between node operators and users, facilitating collaboration and community engagement.

- **Decentralized Marketplace:**  
  A platform for buying, selling, and trading storage capacity and related services, empowering users to monetize excess resources.

- **Node Reward System & Creators Hub:**  
  An incentive model to reward storage node runners, coupled with a dedicated hub for content creators to monetize and share their work.
