## ðŸš€ Run a Storage Node

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Go (1.21+)**
- **Docker** (for running dependencies like IPFS)
- **Git** (to clone the repository)

### Install Go and Docker

#### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y golang-go docker.io git
```

#### Windows

Download and install Go from golang.org.
Install Docker Desktop from docker.com.
Install Git from git-scm.com.

#### macOS
```bash
brew install go docker git
```

### Clone and Run the Node

Clone the repository and start the storage node:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ArguableExorcist8/desvault-storage-node.git
cd desvault-storage-node
./desvault run
```

### This command will start several services in one terminal:

-**IPFS Daemon (runs on port 5001)**: Handles decentralized file networking.

- **API Server (runs on port 8080)**: Manages file uploads, downloads, and other API requests.

- **Secure QUIC Channel (runs on port 4242)**: Provides TLS-based secure communications.

- **Node Networking**: Manages peer discovery and seed node integration.

### ðŸ“Š File Upload/Download Specifications

- **Upload Speed (Moderate)**: 5â€“10 Mbps
- **Download Speed (Moderate)**: 10â€“25 Mbps
- **Maximum File Size**: 500 MB per file (files exceeding this limit will be rejected)

### Master API & Seed Nodes
**Master API**:
Coordinates shard distribution, authentication, and reputation tracking. A hybrid failover setup is planned with a secondary API on a different cloud provider for redundancy.

**Seed Nodes (Decentralized Bootstrap)**:
Multiple seed nodes can be run by different users to enhance network discovery and reliability.

**Logging & Monitoring**: 
Ensure proper logging is set up for debugging and performance monitoring.

**Security Best Practices**: 
Regularly update dependencies and monitor for security advisories.
